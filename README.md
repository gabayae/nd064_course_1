## Phase -1


**Exercise 01**

Extend the Python Flask application with `/status` and `/metrics` endpoints, considering the following requirements:

   - Both endpoints should return an HTTP 200 status code
    
   - Both endpoints should return a JSON response e.g. `{"user": "admin"}`. (Note: the JSON response can be hardcoded at this stage)
    
   - The `/status` endpoint should return a response similar to this example: result: `OK - healthy`
    
   - The `/metrics` endpoint should return a response similar to this example: `data: {UserCount: 140, UserCountActive: 23}`

Tips: If you get stuck, feel free to check the solution video where detailed operations are demonstrated.
